# dynm: a python package for sequencial inference in univariate dynamic models

The `dynm`is a `Python` package for sequential inference in univariate dynamic models, enabling the consideration of structural blocks (polynomial, regression, seasonality with Fourier series, autoregressive terms, and transfer functions) to generate future forecasts using predictive distributions and retrospective analysis through the posterior distributions of state-space parameters.
